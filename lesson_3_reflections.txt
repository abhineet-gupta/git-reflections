Q1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?
A1. When having a cloud backup is considered important, and when other 
people are working on that repository.

Q2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A2. Because other people may have pushed changes to that repository
that we do not want to be automatically reflected in our local copy.
Also, this could become traffic intense.
