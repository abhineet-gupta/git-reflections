Q1. What happens when you initialise a respository? Why do you need to do it?
A1. Initialising a repository creates the .git folder in that directly. 
This is used for git's inner workings i.e. keeping track of file changes.

Q2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
A2. Staging area contains the files that will be part of a single commit.
Working directory contains ALL the files that are in the folder.
Repository is a collection of files that git is keeping track of 
and the changes/commits made to them over time.
Staging area allows us to 'stage' our changes that will form part of the 
next commit. This means we have better control over what gets committed.
